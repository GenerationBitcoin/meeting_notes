# Meeting Notes

At GenB we keep track of what was discussed at meetings by writing notes. One or two of our members volunteer to write these notes each meeting and our members can read them to find out what happened at a meeting if they missed it. We realized that the general public may also find these meeting notes useful to learn more about Bitcoin and find good resources to learn from. Any of our members can open a PR to this repo if there is something that was missed or there are any relevant resources related to a certain topic.
